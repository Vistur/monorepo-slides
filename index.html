						# FROM MONOLITH TO MONOREPO THROUGH MULTIREPO
						A tale of code sharing and productivity
						Note:
						This is a highly controversial theme.

						I'll just try to explain my journey and the reasoning behind why me and other people choose this approach.

						## The monolith
						> "A monolithic application describes a software application which is designed without modularity."
						\- Wikipedia
						Note:
						Modularity is desirable, in general, as it supports reusability.

						It is also deirable because it facilitates maintenance by modifying modules instead of the whole aplication.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						## Starting point
						- Applications in ¨admin¨ repo
							- STM/ATM, Claims, Branch selector, random scripts ...
						- Applications in other repos
							- Eagle, Purchase App
						Note:
						This is how it looked like when I first landed in Auto1.

						A bunch of applications spread through admin and other repos.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						## A lot of similarities
						- Similar third party dependencies (react, redux...)
						- Same programming languages (js, css, html...)
						- Handling application state (flux)
						- Handling HTTP requests
						- Handling translations
						Note:
						They were developed ina a pretty similar way but not exactly.

						Tis is what happens when you have developers in and out, whitout modularity in mind and no guidance whatsoever.

						## Problems
						- No modularity
							- No reusability
							- Different approaches (confusion)
							- Thightly coupled code
								- Bad developer experience
							- Big code base (no DRY)
						Note:
						But all of them were built from scratch because there was no modularity.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						## The multirepo
						Split the reusable and complex parts of your application into single repositories.
						Note:
						So we thought it'd be a great idea to split our apps into small reusable modules and treating them as separate projects in their own repo.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						## Pros
						- Modularity
							- Reusable code accross projects
						- Less codebase == less intimidating
						- Independent build/deploy
						Note:
						Now we have modularity and we are able to reuse our code across multiple projects.

						Every module is easier to to understand because it has less code and does one single thing.

						And by reusing our code we are also reducing our overall codebase.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						## Cons
						- Easy to break other projects
						- Hard to do cross project changes / refactor
						- Hard to track and manage dependencies
						- Tend to loose scope of the whole app
						Note:
						But as it often happens in software development, there is no silver bullet and we have to pay the price for improvements.

						Read the cons.

						I think that a very common problem in software development ilustrates very well all of this points.

						### Diamond dependency problem

						Note:
						Admin depends on Changelog and Logistics and they depend on React

						### Diamond dependency problem

						Note:
						A new version ov React came out and we decide it'll be useful for Logistics.

						### Diamond dependency problem
						<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
							<img src="/dd3.png" />
							<ul>
								<li>Easy to break other projects</li>
								<li>Hard to do cross project changes / refactor</li>
								<li>Hard to track and manage dependencies</li>
								<li>Tend to loose scope of the whole app</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						Note:
						We may break other modules/projects because from within a repo we don't really know who else is using it.

						This can be solved by keeping backwards compatibility which creates technical debt and it may limit our possibilities.

						Another way to solve it is to enforce great a discovery culture in the company through great documentation.

						But still you can see how painful it would be to do cross module modifications and update dependencies.

						Very easy to forget that you are developing for admin.

						## The monorepo
						Software architecture that facilitates the development of multiple projects inside one single repository.
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						## Pros
						- Test whole app
						- Easier cross project changes / recatoring
						- Better tooling
						- Implicit discovery culture
						- We can still build & deploy modules independently
						- Better understanding of the application as a whole
						Note:
						- Single test suite, static code analysis, etc...
						- One single commit
						- Easier too deveop tools for cross project tasks
						- Easier to find packages/modules/code
					</textarea>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						# Cons
						- Merge hell without trunk-based development
						- More intimidating codebase

						Note:

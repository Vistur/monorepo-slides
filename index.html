						- We had different FE/React applications in admin repo
							- STM
							- Claims
							- Branch selector
						- We had other FE/React applications in other repos
							- Eagle
							- ...
						- They were all pretty similar in many aspects
							- Handling application state
							- Handling HTTP requests
							- Handling translations

						- They did not share any of those implementations
						- Most of the times were completely different
						- Most of the implementations were super tightly coupled
						- No reusable across projects
						- There is no standard
						- That leads to confusion

					<textarea data-template>
						Soution -> Micro-services/components based architecture
						- Put reusable pieces of code in a separate repo
						- mutirepo yo loose the scope and understanding of the whole app
						- mutirepo you don't now if you are breaking someone else's code because you are not testing everything

						example of local file system with multiple projects using same dependency to ilustrate the pain of updating dependencies
						i.e. Changelog, Lifecycle & Logistics use fetch

						- IN A MONOREPO WE CAN EASILY test the app as a whole
						- IN A MONOREPO WE CAN EASILY CREATE A SCRIPT THAT UPDATES ALL THE PACKAGES USING A DEPENDENCY THAT WE JUST UPDATED.
						- better cross project changes
						- in a monorepo we can easily make sure that we are using only one version of a dependency
						- a monorepo makes you think carefuly about your dependency tree
						- in a monorepo we can still build and deploy individualy only the modified packages
						- in a moonorepo you have a better understanding of the application as a whole
						- in a monorepo it's easier to locate all the parts that compose an app

						CONCLUSION
						- sharing is caring
							- modularise everything
						- think twice before creating a new repo
						- make your life easier
							- automate everything
						- be responsible
							- test everything
